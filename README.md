# python_telegram_console

Telegram bot as a python console.

It can motivate new learners cause they will see their code working just like a real project (Cause console apps don't look like real apps, especially for someone who just started to learn programming).

Note: Pycharm will be better cause in Spyder Ide it lets you run the code twice in the same time so maybe some people will have problems with that but I made the video in Spyder cause most students use it.

**3.** Download the GitHub files and unzip it.

**4.** Open main.py and paste the token in its correct place.


### How to use:

**1.** Write your normal console python code in the correct place in main.py

**2.** Use tprint() and tinput() instead of print() and input()

**3.** Run your python code first.

**4.** Then send any message to your bot to start interacting with your python code.
